.. title:: Collections | Collections Abstraction library for PHP

=================
Welcome to Collections
=================

What is it?
==============

The Collection library is one of the most useful things that many modern languages has, but for some reason
PHP doesn't has a built in collection layer.

For that reason we created Collections, an incredible library that gathers the best of .NET's and Java's
collections patterns and unify it with PHP array power.
