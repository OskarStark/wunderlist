Welcome to Wunderlist PHP SDK

What is it?
==============

This is the unofficial Wunderlist SDK for PHP!!

The Wunderlist API provides REST-based storage and synchronization of a user’s lists across multiple
platforms and devices. The primary things you’ll need to use it are an understanding of our data model,
how we version individual entities in a user’s data, the formats we use for transmission, and a set
of OAuth credentials.

The PHP SDK helps you to interact with this API.
